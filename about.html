									we'll give a refresher just in case.</p>

									<h3>About the Bride and Groom</h3>
									
									<p>Sarah and Johari live in New York City; Sarah is a staff writer at Space.com, where she writes
									and edits for fun and profit, and Johari is an actor and composer who spends late nights as a 
									legal assistant. Outside of work, Johari can be found playing video games, being asked to define 
									science terms, and working on his musical adaptation of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar." Sarah can 
									be found reading, looking at pictures of tiny robots on the internet, and trying to remember how 
									to make websites. We can both be found singing excerpts from musicals to one another 
									with no particular prompting.</p>
									<p>The duo met in eighth grade, but didn't become close friends until Sarah asked Johari to prom 
									Junior year in the midst of the spring musical rehearsal process. Immediately after asking, Sarah 
									had a voice lesson, and after that she fell into a ditch next to the stairs leading to the school 
									parking lot and broke her foot. However, that didn't stop a very fun prom which prominently featured 
									a decorated red cast.</p>
									<p>After that — despite Johari's best efforts — they didn't begin dating until midway through 
									Freshman year of college, spending endless hours talking on Facebook chat (until it became unusable) 
									and then Google chat, and finally beginning a long-distance relationship.</p>
									<p>It's been seven and a half years since then; college for math and physics (respectively), 
									graduate school and a professional acting program (respectively) have come and gone, and it 
									seemed like it was finally time to make their love and the life they're building together official. 
									(Even more official than the couple's Facebook relationship statuses, which were momentously updated in 
									February of 2010.)</p>
									<p>We hope you can join us to celebrate embarking on that journey.</p>

									in the Cleveland Jewish News</a>! The print version had Sarah's head precipitously close to 
									the bottom of the frame, but luckily the online entry features a full-length photo.</p>
